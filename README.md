About The App
This project is a responsive web application developed with Next.js and Bootstrap for viewing data from the Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API. The interface allows users to search and view art collection data seamlessly across various devices, with built-in authentication functionality.

Technologies
Next.js: Framework used for server-side rendering and building the frontend application.
Bootstrap: Frontend framework used for responsive design and layout of the user interface.
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Approach

Status
This project is complete and ready for use.
